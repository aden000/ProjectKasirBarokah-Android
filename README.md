- Aditiya Gusti Apriliansyah
> they are from same campus as me.

Summary
-
This project is continued from repository ProjectPBOandBD, as they are similar program, but in this program we remove some feature
and now, the program in android only managing item (Barang), and Yusuf work with web based, as Full feature 
(why this android app is not full feature as web based, because we study Java Programming, mid semester is making Desktop app, and
mid semester next is android, they are same programming language, but we need to learn new feature and rest api, because android didn't
support jdbc mysql/mariadb (i have tried it, and didn't work), then we finalize that feature in android app only managing item, aditiya
work with me to learn some feature that can't implemented on android)

Dependencies
-
- Android Studio based project
- Retrofit2 / Volley (my friends recommend Retrofit because it has easy implementation for him)
- Internet connection (through Wi-Fi Hotspot from mobile phone xD)
